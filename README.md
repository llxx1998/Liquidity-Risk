# Liquidity-Risk


## HMM.py file: 
This code uses hmmlearn.hmm package's GaussianHMM tool to implement HMM model. 

## UnitLatentStruct.py file: 
This code is a step by step implementation of HMM model. I transferred and reprogrammed for our purposes. To my delight, the states are consistent with the aforesaid tool.

## Kyle.py file:
This code cleans CRSP equity data from 2006 to 2009, and implements Kyle & Obiz (2014) liquidity measure - price invariant impact measure. 

## HMM_package.py file: 
This code uses the code from the word material written by Oleg. Because this code is for discrete observable, I did not use this for implementation.
